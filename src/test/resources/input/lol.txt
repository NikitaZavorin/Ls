What is the difference between a primitive type and a reference type? Examples (from standard types/standard library).
There are 8 primitive data types in total. byte, short, long, int, double, float, char, boolean.
The main differences:

The value of a primitive variable is stored directly on the stack.
A reference type has a reference stored in the stack (the number of the cell in memory) where the value is stored, and the value of the variable itself is stored in the heap.
Reference types have methods.
A primitive type always has a value, a reference type can be null.
Reference types are written with a capital letter.
The size of the primitive depends on the data type (int - 4 bytes)

void is a primitive indication of the absence of a type.

For primitive types, there are wrapper reference types. This one is needed for collections, for example, since they contain only reference types.
